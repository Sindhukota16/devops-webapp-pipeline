\# DevOps Learning Journey - Daily Notes



\## Day 1 - November 20, 2025

\### Today's Goal: Set up Git and GitHub



\### What I Learned:



\#### 1. What is Version Control?

\- Version control tracks changes to files over time

\- Like 'Track Changes' in Word, but for code

\- Lets you see who changed what and when

\- You can go back to any previous version



\#### 2. What is Git?

\- Git is a version control system

\- Runs on your local computer

\- Created by Linus Torvalds (who also created Linux)

\- Most popular version control tool in the world



\#### 3. What is GitHub?

\- GitHub is a cloud platform for Git

\- Stores your code online (like Google Drive for code)

\- Lets you collaborate with other developers

\- Acts as a portfolio to show your work



\### Commands I Used:



```bash

\# Check Git version

git --version



\# Configure Git with my name

git config --global user.name "Your Name"



\# Configure Git with my email

git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"



\# Clone (download) a repository from GitHub

git clone <repository-url>



\# Check status of files

git status



\# Add files to staging area

git add .



\# Commit (save) changes with a message

git commit -m "Your message here"



\# Push (upload) to GitHub

git push origin main

```



\### What I Built:

\- Created a GitHub account

\- Created my first repository: devops-webapp-pipeline

\- Built a simple HTML web page

\- Pushed my first code to GitHub



\### Challenges I Faced:

The challenges that I may faced is with the spacing the command line and I have corrected them and run the command again 



\### Key Takeaways:

1\. Git tracks changes locally on my computer

2\. GitHub stores my code online

3\. The basic workflow is: add → commit → push

4\. Every commit should have a clear, descriptive message



\### Tomorrow's Plan:

\- Learn about Docker and containers

\- Create a Dockerfile

\- Build my first container image
